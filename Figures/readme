This directory contains all scripts used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript:

“Multi-omics survival modeling identifies paclitaxel resistance–informed prognostic genes and pathways and derives a validated gene signature in breast cancer.”

Each script reproduces one manuscript figure using preprocessed molecular and clinical data. Below, we summarize the purpose and content of each figure.

⸻

Fig. 1 — Clinical characteristics of METABRIC and TCGA-BRCA cohorts

Script: Figure1_Manuscript.R

This figure summarizes baseline clinical characteristics of the two cohorts used in the study:
	•	Age distributions (histograms with mean and median values)
	•	Tumor stage distributions (including NA categories)
	•	PAM50 intrinsic subtype composition (including unclassified samples)

A single legend is used across panels, with red representing METABRIC and blue representing TCGA-BRCA.
This figure establishes cohort comparability and highlights key clinical differences.

⸻

Fig. 2 — Independent gene- and pathway-level prognostic associations

Script: Figure2_Manuscript.R

This figure identifies molecular features independently associated with overall survival:
	•	Gene-level volcano plots from multivariate CoxPH models (METABRIC and TCGA-BRCA)
	•	Forest plot of reproducible prognostic genes with fixed-effect meta-analysis
	•	Pathway-level volcano plots based on expression- and CNA-derived pathway scores
	•	Forest plot of pathway-level hazard ratios across cohorts and meta-analysis

Color coding distinguishes expression-driven (blue) and CNA-driven (red) effects.
This figure defines the candidate genes and pathways used in downstream modeling.

⸻

Fig. 3 — KM survival analyses of independently prognostic genes

Script: Figure3_Manuscript.R

Kaplan–Meier analyses evaluate survival stratification for selected gene-level markers:
	•	SERPINE1 expression (maxstat-based, cohort-specific cutoffs)
	•	CNA status of CXCR4, LAMB2, CLDN1, and LYPD6B (cohort-specific medians)

Hazard ratios are derived from CoxPH models adjusted for age, tumor stage, and PAM50 subtype.
High expression or CNA-altered status consistently associates with poorer OS.

⸻

Fig. 4 — Independent prognostic relevance of Ras signaling pathway CNA burden

Script: Figure4_Manuscript.R

This figure evaluates Ras signaling pathway CNA burden using:
	•	KM stratification in METABRIC and TCGA-BRCA
	•	Systematic CoxPH modeling with and without clinical covariates
	•	Fixed-effect meta-analysis

Patients with high pathway-level CNA burden show significantly worse survival.
This figure establishes Ras signaling as the only pathway retaining independent prognostic value after adjustment.

⸻

Fig. 5 — Multicollinearity assessment and gene-signature feature selection

Script: Figure5_Manuscript.R

This figure guides selection of non-redundant genes for the prognostic signature:
	•	Correlation heatmap using point-biserial (expression–CNA) and phi coefficients (CNA–CNA)
	•	Model discrimination (C-index)
	•	Model complexity (AIC)
	•	Incremental contribution (likelihood ratio tests)

Results justify selection of LYPD6B CNA over CXCR4 CNA for the final signature.

⸻

Fig. 6 — Prognostic validation of the gene-signature risk score

Script: Figure6_Manuscript.R

This figure validates the gene-signature risk score:
	•	CoxPH models in METABRIC (no clinical covariates) and TCGA-BRCA (with covariates)
	•	KM stratification using a median cutoff defined in METABRIC and applied unchanged to TCGA-BRCA

The risk score remains independently prognostic across cohorts and model specifications.

⸻

Fig. 7 — Temporal performance of the gene-signature risk score

Script: Figure7_Manuscript.R

Temporal robustness of the gene signature is evaluated using:
	•	Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) differences
	•	Time-dependent AUC analyses (up to 200 months)

Results show sustained prognostic separation with cohort-specific temporal dynamics.

⸻

Fig. 8 — KM analysis of pathway-level CNA burden across cohorts

Script: Figure8_Manuscript.R

KM analyses assess CNA burden for:
	•	Ras signaling
	•	Axon guidance
	•	Focal adhesion

Median cutoffs derived in METABRIC are applied unchanged to TCGA-BRCA.
High CNA burden consistently associates with poorer OS across pathways and cohorts.

⸻

Fig. 9 — Combined gene-signature and pathway-level CNA models

Script: Figure9_Manuscript.R

This figure evaluates whether pathway-level CNA scores improve prediction beyond the gene signature:
	•	Heatmap of HRs across model combinations
	•	Forest plots of HRs and 95% CIs

While pathway CNA scores are prognostic individually, their effects are attenuated when the gene signature is included, demonstrating the dominant contribution of the gene-level model.

⸻

Fig. 10 — Integration with clinical covariates

Script: Figure10_Manuscript.R

Multivariate CoxPH models integrate:
	•	Clinical covariates
	•	Gene-signature risk score
	•	Ras signaling pathway CNA score

The gene signature remains strongly prognostic across all clinically adjusted models, while Ras pathway effects are attenuated after signature inclusion.

⸻

Fig. 11 — Network representation of resistance-associated prognostic biology

Script: Figure11_Manuscript.R

This network contextualizes prognostic genes and pathways identified in paclitaxel resistance:
	•	Nodes represent genes or KEGG pathways
	•	Edges represent gene–pathway membership
	•	Node color and shape encode prognostic significance and molecular modality
	•	Hypergeometric testing identifies non-random accumulation of prognostic genes

The Axon guidance pathway shows significant enrichment of CNA-driven prognostic genes.

	•	All figures are generated using R (ggplot2-based visualization).
	•	Scripts assume that preprocessing and survival-analysis outputs are available.
	•	Large input/output files are intentionally excluded from version control.
