# Figures

This directory contains all scripts used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript:

*Multi-omics survival modeling identifies paclitaxel resistance–informed prognostic genes and pathways and derives a validated gene signature in breast cancer.*

Each script reproduces one manuscript figure using preprocessed molecular and clinical data.

## Overview of Figures

| Figure | Script | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Fig. 1** | `Figure1_Manuscript.R` | Clinical characteristics of METABRIC and TCGA-BRCA cohorts, including age distributions, tumor stage composition (with NA categories), and PAM50 intrinsic subtypes. A shared legend is used (red: METABRIC, blue: TCGA-BRCA). |
| **Fig. 2** | `Figure2_Manuscript.R` | Independent gene- and pathway-level prognostic associations identified using multivariate CoxPH models. Includes volcano plots, forest plots, and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Expression-driven (blue) and CNA-driven (red) effects are distinguished. |
| **Fig. 3** | `Figure3_Manuscript.R` | Kaplan–Meier survival analyses for independently prognostic genes. SERPINE1 expression is stratified using maxstat, while CXCR4, LAMB2, CLDN1, and LYPD6B CNAs are stratified by cohort-specific medians. |
| **Fig. 4** | `Figure4_Manuscript.R` | Prognostic evaluation of Ras signaling pathway CNA burden using KM analyses, CoxPH models with and without clinical covariates, and fixed-effect meta-analysis. |
| **Fig. 5** | `Figure5_Manuscript.R` | Multicollinearity assessment and feature selection for gene-signature construction using correlation analysis, C-index, AIC, and likelihood ratio tests. Results support selection of LYPD6B CNA over CXCR4 CNA. |
| **Fig. 6** | `Figure6_Manuscript.R` | Validation of the gene-signature risk score using CoxPH and KM analyses in METABRIC (training) and TCGA-BRCA (validation), demonstrating robust and independent prognostic performance. |
| **Fig. 7** | `Figure7_Manuscript.R` | Temporal assessment of the gene-signature risk score using restricted mean survival time (RMST) differences and time-dependent AUC analyses up to 200 months. |
| **Fig. 8** | `Figure8_Manuscript.R` | Kaplan–Meier analyses of pathway-level CNA burden (Ras signaling, Axon guidance, and Focal adhesion) using METABRIC-derived median cutoffs applied unchanged to TCGA-BRCA. |
| **Fig. 9** | `Figure9_Manuscript.R` | Evaluation of combined gene-signature and pathway-level CNA models. Heatmaps and forest plots show that pathway CNA effects are attenuated when the gene signature is included. |
| **Fig. 10** | `Figure10_Manuscript.R` | Integration of gene-signature risk score and Ras signaling pathway CNA burden with clinical covariates in multivariate CoxPH models. |
| **Fig. 11** | `Figure11_Manuscript.R` | Network-based integration of paclitaxel resistance–associated genes and pathways with prognostic validation. Node and edge attributes encode molecular modality, prognostic significance, and effect size. |

## Notes

- All figures are generated in **R** using **ggplot2-based visualization**.
- Scripts assume that preprocessing and survival-analysis outputs are available.
- Large input and output files are intentionally excluded from version control.
